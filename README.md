# Hey! I'm Ammar
I'm a Front End Developer and a graduate of NYU (Economics & Business Studies). I have a passion for building beautiful and accessible UI.

Most of my work is tucked away in private repos. I'm always up for a chat about my experiences or to showcase my skills â€” feel free to reach out!
